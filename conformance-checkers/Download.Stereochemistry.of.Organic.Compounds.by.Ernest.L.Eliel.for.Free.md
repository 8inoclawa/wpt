Stereochemistry is important for understanding the structure, function, and reactivity of organic molecules. Stereochemistry can affect the physical properties, biological activity, and chemical reactions of organic compounds. For example, stereochemistry can determine the flavor and smell of food, the potency and side effects of drugs, and the selectivity and yield of synthetic methods.
 
One of the main challenges of stereochemistry is to predict and control the stereochemical outcome of organic reactions. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by Ernest L. Eliel provides many examples and exercises to help you learn how to apply stereochemical principles and rules to various types of organic reactions. You will also learn how to use modern techniques and tools to analyze and manipulate the stereochemistry of organic compounds.
 
Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by Ernest L. Eliel is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of stereochemistry and its applications in organic chemistry. The book is well-written, clear, and comprehensive, covering both theoretical and practical aspects of stereochemistry. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to excel in organic chemistry.
