One of the challenges of cyber law is to balance the interests of different stakeholders, such as individuals, businesses, governments, and international organizations, in a dynamic and globalized environment. Cyber law also needs to adapt to the rapid changes in technology and society, and to address the emerging threats and opportunities posed by cyberspace.
 
To help readers understand the basics and nuances of cyber law, Vivek Sood has written a comprehensive book titled *Cyber Law Simplified*. The book presents a harmonious analysis of the key provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (TI Act), which is the primary legislation governing cyber law in India, in consonance with the relevant aspects of several other laws of the land that impact jurisdiction in cyberspace. The book also covers the international aspects of cyber law, such as the United Nations resolutions, the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, and the WIPO treaties on intellectual property rights.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the concept and scope of cyber law; Part II discusses the various types of cybercrimes and their legal remedies; Part III deals with the issues of cyber security and data protection; and Part IV explores the topics of intellectual property rights, e-commerce, e-governance, and cyber liability. The book also provides case studies, illustrations, tables, charts, and diagrams to explain the complex concepts in a simple and lucid manner.
 
*Cyber Law Simplified* is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn about the legal aspects of cyberspace. It is suitable for students, professionals, researchers, policymakers, lawyers, judges, and anyone who uses ICTs in their personal or professional lives. The book is also a valuable resource for preparing for various competitive examinations and certifications related to cyber law.
  
The book also contains a glossary of technical and legal terms, a list of abbreviations, and a bibliography of relevant sources for further reading. The book is updated with the latest developments and amendments in cyber law, such as the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.

He is also a visiting faculty at various institutions and a speaker at national and international conferences on cyber law. He has authored several books and articles on cyber law and related topics.
